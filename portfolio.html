						<h2><b>WWE Undefeated</b></h2>
						<p>I helped define WWE Undefeated's core systems and economy design from pre-production through release. I took over as Lead Designer a couple months after launch and manage a team of 5 designers. As our studio's Lead Designer, I'm also responsible for R&D of new systems, economies, and NFT tokenomics for nWay's slate of upcoming blockchain projects.</p>

						<h2><b>Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery</b></h2>
						<p>I joined towards the end of Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery's soft launch and was initially responsible for core systems and economy design. My responsibilities grew over time to managing a junior designer, contributing to product roadmap planning, and owning economy balance and live ops design.</p>
